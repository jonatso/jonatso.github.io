      <description>This is a remix of a track made by the Norwegian duo ka2. I really love their club music, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite impressed by how successful they&amp;rsquo;ve been with seemingly niche house music, with norwegian lyrics. I wanted to make a remix that was a bit more energetic, inspired by psy trance basslines. I shared it with ka2 and it seemed like they liked it, which was really cool! ðŸ¤™</description>

      <title>KUÄŒKA â€” No Good For Me (Jonatan Solheim Flip)</title>

      <description>KUÄŒKA had a remix competition for her track &amp;ldquo;No Good For Me&amp;rdquo;, and I decided to remix it even though I first heard the song after the deadline. At the time I was heavily inspired by more laidback house music, and also by the track &amp;ldquo;One night in Bangkok&amp;rdquo; from the musical Chess. The chorus of &amp;ldquo;One night in Bangkok&amp;rdquo; has an interesting effect where the reverb of some of the instruments disappears on parts of the chorus, which I also incorporated in this remix.</description>
